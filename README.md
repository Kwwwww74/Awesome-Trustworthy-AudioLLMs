## 🌍Introduction  

With the rapid developmenst of **Audio Large Language Models (Audio-LLMs)**, ensuring their **trustworthiness and safety** has become an essential research frontier.  

This repository(TALLM) serves as a **comprehensive and community-driven hub** for tracking progress in the field of **trustworthy audio intelligence**. 

It highlights research on:
- 🛡️ **Safety**
- ⚖️ **Fairness**  
- 🔮 **Hallucination** 
- 🔐 **Privacy** 
- ⚙️ **Robustness**
- 🔖 **Authentication**
- 💡 **Interpretability**
- 💻 **Security**
- 🔍 **Watermark**

Together, these works aim toward a future where Audio-LLMs are **not only capable of understanding voices — but also worthy of being trusted**.
